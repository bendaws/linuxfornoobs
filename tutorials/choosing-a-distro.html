    <h1>Choosing a Linux Distribution (Distro)</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 14px; text-align: center;">A complete guide for beginners. Read the <a href="https://linuxfornoobs.org/quick-start.html">Quick-Start guide</a>.</p>
    <p>
        Choosing a distro is something that might be harder than configuring a distro itself,
        or building one yourself from source. Messing around, searching, and playing with distros will give
        you an idea of how you want a Linux distro to look, feel, and work.
        <br><br>
        This is not a complete list of what you would want for a distro. You should really check online
        for stuff like this, as this is only a little glimpse at all of the distros out there.

        <br><br>

        <p>This image by itself is a tiny scaled-down version of every major distro that has shown up in
            the Linux community. Linux has nearly 1,000 distros that are actively maintained today. Choosing one is not something that is easy.
        <br><br>
            <li id="#distro-ubuntu"><b>Ubuntu</b>: The most popular Linux distro yet. It is based on
                <a href="#distro-debian">Debian</a>, a very stable distro that is also very popular among Linux users.
                It uses the DPKG (debian package) package manager, but is bundled with APT so you can receive
                application updates online.
            </li><br>
            <li id="#distro-debian"><img src="../assets/png/debian.png" height="16"> 
            <b>Debian</b>: An independent distro that is known for being very stable,
                meaning there are very few errors when used correctly. It is the base of most popular and mainstream
                distros, including <a href="#distro-ubuntu">Ubuntu</a>. It uses the DPKG (debian package) package manager, but is bundled with APT so you can receive
                application updates online. It also powers a lot of servers.
                <br>
                <blockquote>
                    Debian is one of the distros offically supported by
                    Linux For Noobs tutorials. If you see the 
                    <img src="../assets/png/debian.png" height="16"> icon, it is instructions for 
                    Debian and it's children (distros based on Debian)
                </blockquote>
            </li>
            <li id="#distro-linux-mint"><b>Linux Mint</b>: A Windows-user friendly distro. It is based on <a href="#distro-debian">Debian</a>, like many other popular distros, but uses
                its own desktop environment called Cinnamon.
            </li><br>
            <li id="#distro-arch-linux"><b>Arch Linux</b>: The dark souls of Linux. Notoriously hard to install, configure, use, 
                and it's community is mostly known for being <censor>assholes</censor>. (kidding). Arch Linux is a very barebones distro. If you're a fan of customization by command line, use Arch.
            </li><br>
            <li id="#distro-manjaro"><b>Manjaro</b>: <a href="#distro-arch-linux">Arch Linux</a>
                but for decent people. Actually easy to install, configure, and use.
                If you're a nice person who wants to be associated with nice things, use Manjaro.
                (kidding) Arch Linux but scaled down to be easier.
